=== Problem 1 ===

Question:
You have 104 dollars. How many packs of dvds can you buy if each pack costs 26 dollars?

Ground Truth Answer:
4.0

Phase 1 - Analysis:
{'problem_type': 'algebra', 'domain': 'math', 'methods': ['isolation', 'simplification'], 'tags': ['linear equation'], 'subtasks': [{'step': 1, 'instruction': 'Identify the variable to isolate'}, {'step': 2, 'instruction': 'Move constants to the other side'}]}

Phase 2 - Primitive Sequence:
  ID: Isolate_d9f4afb5, Name: Isolate, Desc: Isolate a variable on one side of an equation
  ID: Simplify_7e991eef, Name: Simplify, Desc: Simplify an equation

Phase 4 - Execution Steps:
  Primitive Isolate_d9f4afb5 (Isolate):
    Input: You have 104 dollars. How many packs of dvds can you buy if each pack costs 26 dollars?
    Output: 104 / 26 = 4 packs
  Primitive Simplify_7e991eef (Simplify):
    Input: 104 / 26 = 4 packs
    Output: 104 / 26 = 4 packs

Final Solution:
104 / 26 = 4 packs

=== Problem 2 ===

Question:
Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added 2 more action figures to the shelf. How many more books than action figures were on his shelf?

Ground Truth Answer:
2.0

Phase 1 - Analysis:
{'problem_type': 'algebra', 'domain': 'math', 'methods': ['isolation', 'simplification'], 'tags': ['linear equation'], 'subtasks': [{'step': 1, 'instruction': 'Identify the variable to isolate'}, {'step': 2, 'instruction': 'Move constants to the other side'}]}

Phase 2 - Primitive Sequence:
  ID: Simplify_d7c180de, Name: Simplify, Desc: Simplify an equation
  ID: Isolate_74ff327b, Name: Isolate, Desc: Isolate a variable on one side of an equation

Phase 4 - Execution Steps:
  Primitive Simplify_d7c180de (Simplify):
    Input: Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added 2 more action figures to the shelf. How many more books than action figures were on his shelf?
    Output: 4
  Primitive Isolate_74ff327b (Isolate):
    Input: 4
    Output: 4

Final Solution:
4
