=== Problem 1 ===

Question:
You have 104 dollars. How many packs of dvds can you buy if each pack costs 26 dollars?

Ground Truth Answer:
4.0

Phase 1 - Analysis:
{'problem_type': 'algebra', 'domain': 'math', 'methods': ['isolation', 'simplification'], 'tags': ['linear equation'], 'subtasks': [{'step': 1, 'instruction': 'Identify the variable to isolate'}, {'step': 2, 'instruction': 'Move constants to the other side'}]}

Phase 2 - Primitive Sequence:
  ID: Isolate_4c62616b, Name: Isolate, Desc: Isolate a variable on one side of an equation
  ID: Simplify_e1ab0b56, Name: Simplify, Desc: Simplify an equation

Phase 4 - Execution Steps:
  Primitive Isolate_4c62616b (Isolate):
    Input: You have 104 dollars. How many packs of dvds can you buy if each pack costs 26 dollars?
    Output: 104 / 26 = 4 packs
  Primitive Simplify_e1ab0b56 (Simplify):
    Input: 104 / 26 = 4 packs
    Output: 104 / 26 = 4 packs

Final Solution:
104 / 26 = 4 packs

Question:
Melissa scored a total of 91 points in 13 games scoring the same for each game. How many points did she score in each game?

Ground Truth Answer:
7.0

Phase 1 - Analysis:
{'problem_type': 'algebra', 'domain': 'math', 'methods': ['isolation', 'simplification'], 'tags': ['linear equation'], 'subtasks': [{'step': 1, 'instruction': 'Identify the variable to isolate'}, {'step': 2, 'instruction': 'Move constants to the other side'}]}

  ID: Isolate_967454af, Name: Isolate, Desc: Isolate a variable on one side of an equation
  ID: Simplify_8147f17c, Name: Simplify, Desc: Simplify an equation

Phase 4 - Execution Steps:
  Primitive Isolate_967454af (Isolate):
    Input: Melissa scored a total of 91 points in 13 games scoring the same for each game. How many points did she score in each game?
    Output: 91
  Primitive Simplify_8147f17c (Simplify):
    Input: 91
    Output: 91

Final Solution:
91
