Student model - meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-3B-Instruct

Lora training  needed for: 
 - Phase 1 
 - Phase 2 
 - Phase 3(Optional) 

 Models trained:

 L_base - Baseline Model (No training)
 L_reasonMix - Lora adapters trained with SVAMP + GSM8k
 L_gsm - Lora adapters trained with only GSM8k
 
 Test dataset:
    Dataset - SVAMP + GSM8k (Tests)

 Steps for training and testing the model:

 1. L_base:

Training : No training needed
Testing: Direct testing 


 2. L_reasonMix:

   Preprocess dataset:
      dataset --> svamp + gsm8k(few problems)

   
   Training : Preprocess Dataset --> Lora training --> Save trained model

   Testing : Load model --> Test it on svamp + gsm8k


 3. L_gsm:
   Training : Preprocess Dataset --> Lora training --> Save trained model
   Testing : Load model --> Test it on svamp + gsm8k
